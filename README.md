# libft
The "Libft" project serves as the first coding project at 42 School, with the goal of creating a personal library of functions that mimic the behavior of standard C library functions. This foundational project teaches students the inner workings of data types, memory allocation, and basic algorithms, setting the stage for all future projects requiring a deep understanding of C.
